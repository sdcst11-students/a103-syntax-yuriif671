Explain what a syntax error is

Software can have **bugs**.  A software bug is an error in programming that causes the program to stop working, have unexpected results or behave in unexpected ways.  The term comes from early computing days when an actual bug (a moth, in fact) flew into and damaged one of the first comptuers, the Mark II (Wikipedia) Bugs are typically errors in the source code that can be either *syntax errors* or *semantic errors* (also called *logical errors*).

Today we will be looking at syntax errors and correcting them in programs.
A syntax error is an error in the way that the source code for the program is written.  It could be things like unmatched brackets or quotes, errors in case sensitivity, undeclared variables, badly named variables, the list can actually be quite long.

Today, you will be opening 12 programs that are not functioning because they have syntax errors.  
Correct the errors to make sure that they are working and then commit your files
